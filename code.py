There once was a man, a very {v1} {v2}. He worked at  (place) for many years. He was from ___4__(country) and attended __5__ (high school name) University for his studies. He loved to__6__(verb) and spent much of his time with _7_____(person). At Fairfield Prep, Mr. Coffey taught a class about __8__ (your favorite subject) and his favorite student was ___9___ (name of a Prep student). In his class, Mr. Coffey taught students Jesuit ideals and history, and encouraged everyone to be a man for __10__ (plural noun). Mr. Coffey’s favorite Jesuit was St. ___11_ (pet’s name) of _12____ (South American country). Aside from teaching, Mr. Coffey was also the coach of our _13____ (name of a sport) team, where he led his team to win _14_ (number) state championships. After working at Fairfield Prep for two years, Mr. Coffey went to __15___ (name of a college) to finish his Jesuit studies of ___16_ (noun). There, he hopes to become ordained into the Society of __17__ (band name).

One day, while Mr. Coffey was __18__ (verb) in the Jesuit Residence, he found a book called __19__ (name of a book).  While he was ___20___(verb with ing) with this book, he realized his arch nemesis ___21__(name of Prep teacher) was hiding behind the ___22__(piece of furniture). Mr. Coffey ___23__(verb past tense) behind the __24___ (item in your house) in order to hide. While Mr. Coffey watched his nemesis, he took a sip of his  __25__ (flavor) flavored coffee, which tasted very __26__ (adjective). Then, Mr. Coffey watched as __27__ (name of Prep teacher) went into the ___28__ (room in your house) and stole Mr. Coffey’s expensive _29____ (item). 

Seeing this, Mr. Coffey decided to __30___ (verb) after his nemesis. He __31___(adverb) grabbed his ___32__(color) colored __33__(clothing item) and ran out of the door. He realized that the book he was reading was really about ____34__(subject). With Mr. Coffey’s knowledge of this subject, he realized what he had to do. Using the __35__(object) he picked up from the ground of __36__(floor of prep), he _37___ (action verb) it at his nemesis. Mr. Coffey’s nemesis fell down, making a _38____ (adjective) noise. When Mr. Coffee had his nemesis cornered, he realized that the person he was chasing was actually ___39__ (name of Prep administrator). When Mr. Coffey realized this, he was extremely __40__ (emotion).

After seeing that it was not his nemesis, he invited them to _____(restaurant) for some lunch. He ordered ___42__ and ___43___ and his companion ordered __44___ and __45__. 

Just like the Jesuits taught him, Mr. Coffey forgave his enemy for his crime. At the end of the day, Mr. Coffey is a __46__ (adjective) Jesuit who should be a role model for _47___ (group of people). From Mr. Coffey, we can all learn to be __48__ (personality trait), and to never _49__ (verb) our enemy! Hope you have a _50___ (adjective) day!
